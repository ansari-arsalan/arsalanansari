<p>I was admitted to the Class of 2026 in the College of Arts & Sciences at Cornell. It's been great honor for me. The College of Arts and Sciences is a division of Cornell University. It has been part of the university since its founding, although its name has changed over time. It grants bachelor's degrees, and masters and doctorates through affiliation with the Cornell University Graduate School.</p>

<p>The Buddhas of Bamiyan were two 6th-century monumental statues carved into the side of a cliff in the Bamyan valley of central Afghanistan, 130 kilometres northwest of Kabul at an elevation of 2,500 metres. Carbon dating of the structural components of the Buddhas has determined that the smaller 38 m "Eastern Buddha" was built around 570 AD, and the larger 55 m "Western Buddha" was built around 618 AD, which would date both to the time when the Hephthalites ruled the region.</p>

<p>
  THE BLUE MOSQUE HAS BEEN described as an oasis for peace, and it really does seem like it, considering the thousands of white doves surrounding the mosque. The doves flock on the trees, the roof, and the sidewalks. Legend has it the mosque is so sacred that any dove with a speck of color on its feathers will instantly become pure white after entering the mosqueâ€™s vicinity. It's located in the city tha I was born: Mazar-e-Sharif, Balkh, Afghanistan.
