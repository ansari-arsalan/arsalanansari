<h1>Arsalan Ansari</h1>

    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p> Hey everyone! I'm Arsalan, a student at Cornell University, where I attend the College of Arts & Sciences majoring in Government/Poli Sci and Information Science. </p>


            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                I have been involved in social, environmental, and youth activism since 2018â€”working with NGOs & CSOs in Afghanistan and abroad. I'm the Founder of Young Scholars and the first-ever Afghanistan High Schools MUN. On top of that, I have also worked as an ambassador, English instructor, TED translator, and sometimes as a sales assistant (I've had a twisted journey).

                I play guitar, philosophize or read in my spare times. Not to mention, I enjoy fiction and poetry.

                </p>
