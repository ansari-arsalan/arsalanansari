        <p>I talk about how Taliban are against democracy and liberty, explaining the way they jusify their brutality on innocent people and impose their Sharia Law as the supreme order.

          <p>Is Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness a full representation of his stance towards Africans? Did his work perpetuate colonialism? Why Achebe fails to give a real picture of Conrad and his views? Was Conrad “a thoroughgoing racist”? I explore the above questions and more in this piece, analyzing Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (1899), which is one the most well-known and hotly debated novellas concerning Africans in the late-nineteenth century. I argue that Achebe, in his famous essay An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad’s Heart of Darkness has been too radical and extreme in his conclusions, as he blames the book for perpetuating an image of Africa — the kind that prejudices Africans and depicts them as savages — that has been spread in Europe, “it was and is the dominant image of Africa in the Western imagination and Conrad merely brought the peculiar gifts of his own mind to bear on it.” (p. 25) Achebe finds Conrad’s Heart of Darkness full of racism and criticizes him for calling Africa as the “other world” and therefore concluding that Conrad is a “bloody racist.”
